# portfolio

## Description
This portfolio was created to show case my work and progress with coding. I created this webpage using HTML and CSS. I hope to continue modifying this webpage as my knowledge progresses. This webpage allows for all of my work and contact information to be in one area making it more accessible for others to view. While working on this webpage I got to play with the different CSS colors and see what colors go well together. I also got to debug code I kept breaking and reworking the webpage to my liking. 


## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Open Chrome DevTools to show you code used for webpage. You can use Chrome DevTools to see the different areas of the webpage and how the CSS sheet correlates to the HTML.
